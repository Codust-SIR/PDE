### Analysis

The email appears authentic at first glance. Let's evaluate its authenticity.

Is this email suspicious?

- [x] Yes
- [ ] No

Good judgment! This email indeed raises suspicion.

**Reasons for Suspicion:**

The inclusion of an IP address in the link (202.14.130.66) instead of a standard website address (e.g., www.studentbank.com) is a red flag. Legitimate organizations typically use domain names, not IP addresses, in their communications. Always verify the legitimacy of the URL by entering the root IP address directly into a web browser.

**Next Steps:**

Do you understand why this email is suspicious?

- [x] Yes
- [ ] No

**Response:** Links containing IP addresses, such as 202.14.130.66, are indicative of potential phishing attempts. It's advisable to refrain from interacting with such emails and instead contact the organization's official support line for clarification.

### Understanding Phishing Attacks

Phishing is a fraudulent practice where cybercriminals attempt to acquire sensitive information, such as usernames, passwords, and financial details, by posing as trustworthy entities in electronic communications. Recognizing and avoiding phishing attempts is essential to safeguarding personal and financial security online.
